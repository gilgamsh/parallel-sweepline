# parallel-sweepline
This repository contains codes to accelerate the sweepline algorithm using GPU (CUDA).

## Plan

We intend to make the code from our paper open source. However, due to licensing issues, we will not release the industrial designs and dsn parser used for testing.

Current development is at dev branch.
